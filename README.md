# Machine-Learning-Clustering-Project
Employees across the world are entitled for holidays / vacations. It has also been noticed that some
employees are absent during work hours due to various reasons. This may have adverse effects to the
team / department in its daily progress.
The clustering technique will help an organization to understand some reasons why employees tend to
be away from work. By creating these clusters, a lot of attention can be given to address issues, take
corrective actions, or implementing better working conditions, whatever may be the reason.

# Business Objective
‚óè To create an employee cluster to show
absenteeism at work and try to identify the top
contributors for it.
